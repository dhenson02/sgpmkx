These procedures have been developed to ensure maximum utilization and readiness of personnel, while preserving their health and minimizing risk of further injury or illness. PH will review Aeromedical Services Information Management System (ASIMS) for all AF personnel arriving on the installation on PCS orders to ensure the member doesn’t have any medical readiness issues (immunization, dental, PHA, DLC, etc.). \n\n- AFI 44-102, *Medical Care Management*\n\t- This AFI discusses the role of Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), PH, Flight Medicine (FOM) and Base Safety in assisting MTF providers through the Occupational and Environment Health Working Group (OEHWG) and how to evaluate, quantify risk, and manage work related injury and illness. Also, PH should have an effective prevention of work related illnesses and injuries begins with all medical providers developing a working knowledge of the major occupational activities taking place at their assigned installation. \n- AFI 48-101, *Aerospace Medicine Enterprise*\n\t- This AFI outlines that the AF Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) Program is to protect military and civilian employee health while enhancing combat and operational capabilities. The key team aerospace players are BE, FOM, and PH, these members are responsible for desired effects, indicators, and reporting to OEHWG, AMC, and Installation Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) Council. \n\n- AFI 48-123, *Medical Examinations and Standards*\n- AFI 48-145, *Occupational Health Program*\n\t- This AFI discusses that the AF OEH Program is to protect health while enhancing combat and operational capabilities.

This AFI is intended to minimize the incidence of chemically induced occupational  and environmental health-related illnesses and injuries by establishing guidance for training employees on the health and physical hazards associated with and proper preventive measures to be taken when using or handling hazardous chemicals in work areas. Also, it provides the requirements for an effective AF Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) program for those work areas that have workers who handle or use hazardous chemicals. PH will review HAZCOM training plans for technical accuracy and completeness prior to implementation by the work area supervisor. \n\n- AFI 91-202, *The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program*\n\t- This AFI establishes ways to minimize loss of AF resources and protect AF personnel from death, injuries or occupational illnesses by managing risks on-and off-duty. PH will communicate occupational health education requirements and available resources to supervisors; serve as the initial point of contact for occupational medical monitoring and will report cases of occupational illness to the installation ground safety office through AF Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Also, PH provides a representative to actively participate in ESOH Council to provide consultation on epidemiology, occupational illnesses, and other occupational health program areas. \n\n- AFI 91-204, *Safety Investigations and Reports*\n\t- This AFI provides guidance on investigating and reporting all USAF mishaps. PH is to ensure all occupational and environmental illnesses are investigated in a timely manner and documented in AFSAS. PH will report, monitor, and track occupational illness investigations until completion via the AFSAS Occupational Illness Module. After the provider makes the final determination on the illness report and prior to closing an investigation, PH will review each illness record to ensure internal (within individual report) and external (compared with other similar illness reports) consistency and that quality data has been captured and documented. PH will forward occupational illness information to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 300 log via AFSAS (illness reports which are closed as occupationally-related illnesses are automatically included on the OSHA 300 log). \n\n- AFMAN 48-125, *Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry*\n- AFOSHSTD 48-9, *Electro-Magnetic Frequency (EMF) Radiation Occupational Health Program*\n- AFOSHSTD 48-20, *Occupational Noise and Hearing Conservation Program*\n- AFI 48-137, *Respiratory Protection Program*\n\t- This AFI prescribes the requirements for a unit to have an effective respiratory protection program.

AF Public Health is the Regulatory Authority for food facillity evaluations within AF installations.\n\nWhen foodborne outbreaks do occur, Public Health responds to determine the cause and source of illness. Usually, outbreaks are naturally occurring, but with terrorist threats, intentional contamination must be considered.\n\nThis section provides specific information on how Public Health can effectively prevent and respond to foodborne outbreaks and emphasizes Food Protection related policy, resources, and tools.","Policy":"Program Reference Documents:\n- AFMAN 48-147, *Tri-Service Food Code*\n-\tAFI 10-245, *Antiterrorism (AT)*\n- AFI 10-246, *Food and Water Protection Program*\n- AFI 48-101, *Aerospace Medicine Enterprise*\n- AFI 48-116, *Food Safety Program*\n- AFI 48-110_IP, *Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis*\n- AFI 48-117, *Public Facility Sanitation*\n- AFI 34-248, *Child Development Centers*\n- AFI 34-249, *Youth Programs*\n- AFI 34-276;

or search bar.\n- Add icon next to links that download files (.doc, .pdf, etc) with the icon representing the file type so the user knows it's not some random web page but actually downloadable material.\n- Either:\n  - Page title disappears along with content while loading\n  - Page content and title remain until loading completed and loading animation appears somewhere else.\n\n### Very unlikely, but would like to do, TODOs:\n- Set up alert system to be available from pages\n- Possibly display \"Recently updated items\" list somewhere - could restrict to homepage\n- Syncronize editor and preview pane while scrolling.\n- Create a new SharePoint List that would hold the contributions and tag them by which page they belong to.
